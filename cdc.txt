Overview: Overview

A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. 


Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:

Soreness in the chest
Feeling tired (fatigue)
Mild headache
Mild body aches
Sore throat
Causes: Causes
A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:

Clean your hands.
Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine.
Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Medical care: When to seek medical care

Temperature of 100.4 °F or higher.
Cough with bloody mucus.
Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
Repeated episodes of bronchitis.

This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning.

Talk to a healthcare provider right away‎
If your child is under 3 months old with a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher.
Treatment: Treatment
Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own—without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
How to feel better: How to feel better

Get plenty of rest.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.
Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.
For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.


Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.
Use throat lozenges or cough drops. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.
Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.

Ask your healthcare provider about over-the-counter medicines that can help you feel better. Always use over-the-counter medicines as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicines may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they will not cure your illness.

Other illnesses like whooping cough (pertussis) or pneumonia can have similar symptoms to acute bronchitis. If you have whooping cough or pneumonia, your healthcare provider will most likely prescribe antibiotics.

Overview: What it is
Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms.


A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest.
Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States

Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019.1
In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men.1
A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.2
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.3
Types: Types
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing or swallowing.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs.

Other types
Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
Symptoms: N/A
Causes: N/A
Risk: Risk factors
Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.
Other factors include

High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries)

Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk.
Prevention: N/A
Medical care: N/A
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

Symptoms: Symptoms
Adenoviruses can cause a wide range of signs and symptoms, such as:

common cold or flu-like symptoms


fever


sore throat


acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a "chest cold")


pneumonia (infection of the lungs)


pink eye (conjunctivitis)


acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines causing diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain)



Less common symptoms include:

bladder inflammation or infection


neurologic disease (conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord)
Causes: How it spreads
Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through:

close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands.


the air, by coughing and sneezing.


touching an object or surface with adenoviruses on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands.


through an infected person's stool (e.g., during diaper changing).


through the water, such as swimming pools, but this is less common.



How long a person can spread the virus
Sometimes the virus can be shed (released from the body) for a long time after a person recovers from an adenovirus infection, especially among people who have weakened immune systems. This "virus shedding" usually occurs without any symptoms, even though the person can still spread adenovirus to other people.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Follow simple steps to protect yourself and others
CDC recommends important steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a range of common respiratory viruses, including adenovirus.

Practice good hygiene (practices that improve cleanliness):


Take steps for cleaner air.


When you may have a respiratory virus take steps to prevent spread.


Frequent handwashing is especially important in childcare settings and healthcare facilities.

Respiratory Virus Guidance
Maintain proper chlorine levels to prevent outbreaks‎
It is important to keep adequate levels of chlorine in swimming pools to prevent outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenoviruses. CDC's Healthy Swimming website provides more information on how to maintain healthy and safe swimming environments.
Medical care: N/A
Treatment: Treatment
There are no approved antiviral medicines and no specific treatment for people with adenovirus infection. Most adenovirus infections are mild and may be managed with rest and over-the-counter pain medicines or fever reducers to help relieve symptoms. Always read the label and use medications as directed.
If you have concerns, you should speak with your healthcare provider.

Adenovirus vaccine is for the U.S. military only‎
There is a vaccine for adenovirus types 4 and 7 that is used in military personnel who may be at higher risk for infection from these two adenovirus types. This vaccine contains live virus that can be shed in stool and potentially cause disease in other people if transmitted. The safety and effectiveness of this vaccine has not been studied in the general population or in people with weakened immune systems, and it is not approved for use outside of the military. There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public. For more information about the vaccine, see Adenovirus Vaccine Information Statement (VIS).

Overview: Overview
Sleeping sickness (i.e., human African trypanosomiasis or HAT)) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Sleeping sickness spreads through the bite of a tsetse fly (Glossina species), found only in rural, sub-Saharan Africa. The disease causes death if left untreated. There are two types of sleeping sickness. Each one is named for the region in Africa where it was historically found.
Types:
There are two types of sleeping sickness:
West African sleeping sickness

Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. gambiense.


Disease is slow to progress (a few months to a year or more after exposure).


Found in rural parts of Central and West Africa.


The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of West African sleeping sickness cases reported each year to its website.



East African sleeping sickness

Spread by bites from a tsetse fly carrying the parasite T. b. rhodesiense.


Disease progresses in severity very quickly (one to several weeks after exposure).


Found in rural parts of Eastern and Southern Africa and less commonly reported than West African sleeping sickness.


The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the number of East African sleeping sickness cases reported each year to its website.

Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Sleeping sickness occurs in two stages. The first stage typically causes mild, flu-like symptoms. The second stage causes more severe symptoms that affect your brain and central nervous system. Symptoms of each stage take longer to appear in West African sleeping sickness.
If you recently traveled to east or west Africa and were bitten by a tsetse fly, you could have sleeping sickness. Some people who have sleeping sickness develop a red sore, called a chancre, within two days to two weeks of an infected tsetse fly bite but chancres are not always present or noticed.
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Sleeping Sickness
Causes: How it spreads
You can get sleeping sickness from the bite of an infective tsetse fly. 
Occasionally, a pregnant women may pass the parasite Trypanosoma brucei to her unborn baby. 
Although rare and not well documented, the parasite may also spread through

Sexual contact


Blood transfusion


Organ transplantation


Accidental laboratory exposure
Risk: Risk factors
Sleeping sickness affects people in rural areas of African countries. Travelers to urban areas in those countries are at low risk.
People at higher risk include:

Hunters


Villagers with infected cattle herds


Tourists visiting and others working in game parks



Tsetse flies that spread sleeping sickness live only in some African countries. Most flies in these rural areas are not carrying the parasite that causes sleeping sickness. However, the more often you are bitten, the more you are at risk of infection. 
You cannot contract the disease in the U.S.
Prevention: Prevention
There is no vaccine or drug available to prevent sleeping sickness.
The best way to prevent infection is to prevent bites from the tsetse fly:

Wear protective, neutral-colored clothing, including long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and socks.


Inspect vehicles for tsetse flies before entering.


Avoid bushes.


Use insect repellant.



Read more: Prevent Sleeping Sickness
Medical care: Diagnosis
There are several tests that can diagnose sleeping sickness. Talk with your healthcare provider right away if you have traveled to rural areas of the countries in Africa where sleeping sickness spreads and are experiencing any of the symptoms or think you may have sleeping sickness.
Treatment: Treatment
If diagnosed with sleeping sickness, start medical treatment as soon as possible. Your laboratory results should guide your treatment. 
Hospitalization is usually necessary for treatment. Follow-up care may require lumbar puncture (spinal tap) every six months or sooner, if symptoms return, for two years.

Overview: What Is Alpha-gal Syndrome?
Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic condition that can occur after a tick bite. It's named for a molecule, galactose-α-1,3-galactose, that's found in most mammals. 
Symptoms occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products made from mammals. Because of this, AGS is also known as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. 

The lone star tick is the species mostly associated with AGS, but other kinds of ticks may be involved.
A CDC report showed that between 2010 and 2022, more than 110,000 suspected cases of AGS were identified. However, cases of AGS are not nationally notifiable to CDC, so the actual number of AGS cases in the United States is not known. More data and research are needed to understand how many people are affected by this condition.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: N/A
Causes: Causes
While AGS is associated with tick bites, more research is needed to understand the role ticks play in starting this condition, and why certain people develop AGS.
Risk: Risk factors
AGS is associated with tick bites. In the United States, AGS is primarily associated with the bite of a lone star tick, but other kinds of ticks have not been ruled out. 
Most reported cases of AGS in the United States occur in the South, East, and Central states. These are the areas where most lone star ticks are found. In other countries, other tick species have been linked to AGS.
While people in all age groups can develop AGS, most cases have been reported in adults.
Prevention: Prevention
Preventing tick bites is important and may reduce your chances of developing AGS or other illnesses.
Before you go outdoors: 

Avoid grassy, brushy, and wooded areas where ticks may be found.
Walk in the center of trails.
Treat clothing and gear with permethrin, or buy pre-treated items.
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent.

After you come indoors:

Check your clothing for ticks.
Examine gear and pets for ticks.
Shower and perform a thorough tick check.

 If you see an attached tick, remove it immediately.

Learn how to prevent ticks on your pets and in your yard.
Medical care: Diagnosis
A healthcare provider may diagnose AGS by:  

A physical examination
A detailed patient history
A test for antibodies your body produces in response to alpha-gal

Your healthcare provider may also recommend allergy skin testing.

Overview: Overview
Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is caused by a virus usually spread by ticks. Infections are rare but can be fatal. Since AHF was discovered in 1995, several hundred cases have been reported. AHF cases seem to peak in spring and summer. More research is needed.

AHF has been found in Saudi Arabia and Egypt
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of AHF resemble the flu. These symptoms include:

Fever
Loss of appetite
General malaise
Diarrhea
Vomiting

Sometimes, more severe symptoms can develop:

Brain swelling
Confusion
Neck stiffness
Coma
Bleeding
Multi-organ failure
Low platelet count
Low white blood cell count
Elevated liver enzymes
Causes: How it spreads
Transmission of AHF is not well understood and needs further study. 
AHF is spread to people by ticks, the Ornithodoros savignyi and Hyalomma dromedari species, that feed on livestock and domestic animals. People can become infected through a tick bite or when crushing infected ticks. 
No spread of AHF between people has been documented.
Risk: Risk factors
People may be at risk of AHF if they experience any of the following in areas where the virus is found:

Tick bites
Contact with livestock and domestic animals, like camels, in tick-infested areas
Crushing infected ticks with bare or unprotected fingers
Prevention: Prevention

Avoid tick bites and livestock in areas where AHF is found.
Use tick repellents on skin and clothes.
Check skin for ticks and remove them promptly.
Use tick collars for pets and tick-killing pesticides for livestock.
Medical care: Diagnosis
Healthcare professionals can diagnose AHF early with PCR testing or virus isolation. They can also conduct serologic testing using ELISA later in the course of the illness.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery

There is no specific treatment for AHF.
Supportive care is given to manage symptoms.
1-20% of patients hospitalized for AHF die.

Cystic echinocccosis
Cystic echinocccosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~ – 7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.
Alveolar echinococcosis
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, a ~1 – 4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal.

Overview: Overview

Entamoeba histolytica amebas in a person's small intestine.
Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, or E. histolytica. Anyone can get amebiasis. It is more common if you live in a tropical area with poor sanitary conditions or travel to one of these areas.
If you think you have amebiasis, see your healthcare provider. The disease can be difficult to diagnose. Most people with amebiasis don't get very sick. Everyone with amebiasis should receive medications to treat the infection.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Only about 10% to 20% of people infected with E. histolytica become ill. Even then, symptoms are often mild. They can include diarrhea, stomach pain, and stomach cramping. Symptoms usually develop within 2 to 4 weeks but can show up later. 
A severe form of amebiasis called amebic dysentery can cause stomach pain, bloody poop, and fever. 
Rarely, E. histolytica travels through the blood stream to the liver and forms an abscess (collection of pus). In a small number of instances, the parasite has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and brain.
Causes: Causes
You can get amebiasis if you:

Swallow something such as water or food contaminated with E. histolytica


Put something in your mouth that has touched the poop of someone infected with E. histolytica


Swallow  E. histolytica  germs picked up from a contaminated surface or your fingers
Risk: Risk factors
In the United States, amebiasis is most common in:

People who traveled to tropical places with poor sanitary conditions


Immigrants from tropical countries with poor sanitary conditions


People who live in facilities with poor sanitary conditions


People who have anal sex
Prevention: Prevention

Washing your hands thoroughly can help prevent spreading amebiasis.
You can spread amebiasis to others. The risk is low if you get treated with antibiotics and practice good hygiene. This includes thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom or changing diapers. You should also wash your hands before handling or preparing food or drinks.
If in an area with poor sanitary conditions:
Don't eat or drink: 

Fountain drinks or any drinks with ice cubes


Fresh fruit or vegetables you didn't peel yourself


Milk, cheese, and dairy products that may not have been pasteurized


Food or drinks sold by street vendors



It is safe to drink: 

Bottled water with an unbroken seal


Carbonated (bubbly) water from sealed cans or bottles


Carbonated drinks like soda from sealed cans or bottles


Tap water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute



You also can make tap water safe to drink by first filtering it through an "absolute 1 micron or less" filter. Then dissolve chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or iodine tablets in the filtered water.
Medical care: Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will ask for a sample of your poop. You may be asked for several samples from different days. This is because E. histolytica is not always found in every sample.
Diagnosing amebiasis can be very difficult. Other parasites and cells can look very similar to E. histolytica under a microscope. 
If you've been told that you have an E. histolytica infection but you're feeling fine, you might be infected with a different parasite, Entamoeba dispar, or E. dispar. It is about 10 times more common worldwide. E. dispar doesn't make people sick and doesn't need to be treated. 
Some laboratories, including CDC, have tests that can tell if a person is infected with E. histolytica or E. dispar. Fluid from liver abscesses can also be tested for E. histolytica.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
A healthcare provider can prescribe antibiotics to treat amebiasis. You will take one antibiotic if you're not feeling sick. If you are sick, you'll probably be prescribed a second antibiotic to take after you've finished the first.

Overview: What it is
Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacteria A. phagocytophilum. These bacteria are spread to people by tick bites primarily from:

The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis)


The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus)



People with anaplasmosis will often have fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for adults and children of all ages with anaplasmosis.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1–2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick, however many people do not remember being bitten.

See your healthcare provider if you become ill after being bitten by a tick or have been in areas where ticks live. Ticks commonly live in the woods or in areas with high brush.
Early illness
Early signs and symptoms (days 1-5) are usually mild or moderate and may include:

Fever, chills


Severe headache


Muscle aches


Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite



Late illness
If treatment is delayed or if there are other medical conditions present, anaplasmosis can cause severe illness. Prompt treatment can reduce your risk of developing severe illness.
Signs and symptoms of severe (late stage) illness can include:

Respiratory failure


Bleeding problems


Organ failure


Death



Risk factors for severe illness:

Delayed treatment


65 years of age or older


Weakened immune system



 People with weakened immune systems are at risk for severe illness. This includes people receiving some cancer treatments, individuals with advanced HIV infection, prior organ transplants, or people taking some medications.
Causes: How it spreads
Transmission
Anaplasmosis is a tickborne disease caused by the bacteria A. phagocytophilum.
Tick bites
 A. phagocytophilum is primarily spread to people by the bite of an infected tick.
In the United States, the bacteria are carried by the:

Blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the Northeast and Midwestern United States


Western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) along the West Coast



Blood transfusion

	In rare cases, A. phagocytophilum has been spread by blood transfusion.
Anaplasmosis is most commonly reported in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern states.

Overview: Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities. 
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer. 
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months. 

Resource‎
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Types: Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are: 

Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.


Contaminating drinking water sources.


Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.



Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil. 

Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.


Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.



Hookworm

You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.


Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.


One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including 

Abdominal pain


Diarrhea


Blood and protein or nutrient loss


Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)


Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Causes: N/A
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections 

Wash your hands before handling food.


Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.


Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.


Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Medical care: Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite. 
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or "preventive chemotherapy". 
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children. 
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other "neglected tropical diseases" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

Overview: Overview
Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a parasitic worm of rats. It is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. These larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is completed when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become adult worms.
Types: Species
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is also known as the rat lungworm, causes eosinophilic meningitis and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States.
Angiostrongylus costaricensis causes eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is found in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Symptoms: Symptoms
Some infected people don’t have any symptoms—or have only mild symptoms that don’t last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.
Causes: How it spreads
People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs "on a dare. " People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one.
Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. African land snails, which can grow larger than a person’s hand, is just one of many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested contaminated rat feces. 
It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite.

Resource‎
This video illustrates how people get infected with A. cantonensis or rat lungworm.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables.
Medical care: Testing and diagnosis
See your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and exposures you’ve had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as well as tests for meningitis.
Treatment: Treatment
The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even people who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don’t need antiparasitics. Sometimes the symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body’s immune system responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the symptoms of the infection, such as pain medication for headache or medications to reduce the body’s reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself. Patients with severe cases of meningitis may benefit from some other types of treatment.

Anisakiasis (also known as herring worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes (worms) that attach to the walls of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. 
Anisakiasis is most commonly found in areas where eating raw fish is popular, such as Japan. Because eating undercooked fish is becoming more common, there have been cases in the US, Europe, South America, and other areas of the world.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
People with anisakiasis can experience signs and symptoms such as

Abdominal pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal distention (abnormal abdominal expansion)
Diarrhea
Blood and mucus in stool
Mild fever

People can also experience allergic reactions such as

Rashes
Itching
Infrequently anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)

Some people experience a tingling sensation during or after eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. This sensation is actually the worm moving in the mouth or throat. People can often take the worm out of their mouth themselves or cough it up to prevent infection. Some people experience vomiting, which can often expel the worm from the body.
Causes: How it spreads
When certain infected marine mammals (e.g., whales or sea lions) defecate (poop) in the sea, they release eggs. These eggs become infective larvae while in the water. Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimps) consume the infective larvae, and then fish or squid consume the crustaceans. 
When humans eat raw or undercooked infected fish or squid, they consume the nematode larvae, which can invade the gastrointestinal tract. Eventually, the parasite dies and produces an inflamed mass in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. 
People cannot spread anisakiasis to one another.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
To prevent anisakiasis, do not eat raw or undercooked fish or squid.
Food precautions
The FDA recommends the following for seafood preparation or storage to kill parasites:
Cooking (Seafood in General)

Cook seafood adequately (to an internal temperature of at least 145° F [~63° C]).

Freezing (Fish)

At -4°F (-20°C) or below for 7 days (total time), or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid, and storing at -31°F (-35°C) or below for 15 hours, or
At -31°F (-35°C) or below until solid and storing at -4°F (-20°C) or below for 24 hours.

Medical care: Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can diagnose anisakiasis by endoscopy, radiography, or surgery if the worm is embedded. It is helpful for your healthcare provider to know if you ate undercooked fish or squid.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
Your healthcare provider may remove the worm from your body through endoscopy or surgery.
This information is not meant to be used for self-diagnosis or as a substitute for consultation with a health care provider. If you have any questions about the parasites described above or think that you may have a parasitic infection, consult a health care provider.

Overview: Overview
Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. It's found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affects livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin.
Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer.
Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past.
Most people will never be exposed to anthrax. However, there are jobs, hobbies, and activities that can put some people at higher risk of exposure. 
Anthrax risk and prevention‎
Learn more about who's at risk of exposure and how to prevent anthrax.
Prevention
Types: Types
The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics. 
There are four types of anthrax:
Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair.  It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.
Recently, injection anthrax was identified in heroin-injecting drug users in northern Europe, but it hasn't been reported in the United States. Injection anthrax is similar to cutaneous anthrax and causes infection deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected.

Inhalation anthrax happens when a person breathes in anthrax spores. It's the deadliest form of the disease. People who work in places such as wool mills, slaughterhouses, and tanneries may breathe in the spores when working with infected animals or contaminated animal products. Inhalation anthrax starts primarily in the lymph nodes in the chest before spreading throughout the rest of the body.

Inhalation anthrax happens when people breathe in spores.
Gastrointestinal anthrax happens when a person eats raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal. It has rarely been reported in the United States. It affects the upper gastrointestinal tract (throat and esophagus), stomach, and intestines, causing a wide variety of symptoms. 
View LargerDownload
Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs when a person consumes raw or undercooked meat from an infected animal.

New disease caused by anthrax toxin‎
Welder's anthrax is a newly identified and rare disease that has been found in several people who are welders or metalworkers. This disease causes severe pneumonia and can be fatal. If you are a welder or metalworker and you develop fever and chills with sudden cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood, see a healthcare provider immediately.
Symptoms: Symptoms
The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection. Symptoms show up anywhere from 1 day to more than 2 months after you're exposed to the bacteria that cause anthrax. If you don't get proper treatment, all types of anthrax have the potential to spread through your body and cause severe illness and death.
Cutaneous anthrax

Medical care: If you've been exposed to anthrax
See a healthcare provider immediately and explain how you may have been exposed.  It's important to get medical care as quickly as possible to have the best chances for a full recovery. Doctors can prescribe antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick, or as treatment if you're already sick. There is no test to find out if you have been exposed to anthrax. Public health departments will have to do an investigation to see if and how you were exposed.

Overview: What it is
Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture:

The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection.
The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture.
Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms.


A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest.
Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States

Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019.1
In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men.1
A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms.2
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms.3
Types: Types
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age.4
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following:

Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing or swallowing.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm
An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people.5
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them.6
Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following:

Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side.
Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs.

Other types
Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke. Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery.
Symptoms: N/A
Causes: N/A
Risk: Risk factors
Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm.
Other factors include

High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries)

Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk.
Prevention: N/A
Medical care: N/A
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery. Medicines can lower blood pressure and reduce risk for an aortic aneurysm. Surgery can repair or replace the affected section of the aorta.

Overview: N/A
Types: Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people. 
People are infected with arenaviruses by:

Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent


Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.


Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.


Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.


Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.



Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Overview: Overview
Whipworm, hookworm, and Ascaris are the three types of soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. STH infections occur in areas with warm and moist climates and where sanitation and hygiene are poor. They are considered neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) because they inflict tremendous disability and illness among the affected populations. These communities often lack access to basic or adequate resources. Safe and effective medicines can control NTDs through mass drug administration (MDA) programs in the affected communities. 
Soil-transmitted helminths are worms that live in a person's intestines. An infected person passes the eggs in their feces. The eggs enter the soil when infected people defecate (poop) outside, use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact), or use infected human feces as fertilizer. 
Soil-transmitted helminths are among the most common human parasites globally. You can find them in areas with warm and most climates where sanitation is poor. They may occur in temperate climates during warmer months. 

Resource‎
Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Soil-transmitted Helminths page.
Types: Species
Ascaris and Whipworm
People who consume soil with Ascaris or whipworm eggs in it can become infected with the Ascaris or whipworm parasites. This may happen when soil and eggs are: 

Attached to vegetables or fruits that are not carefully washed, peeled, or cooked before eating.


Contaminating drinking water sources.


Contaminating hands or fingers of people who then put them in their mouths without washing them first.



Ascaris and whipworm eggs become infective as they mature in soil. 

Ascaris infection is also known as ascariasis.


Whipworm infection is also known as trichuriasis.



Hookworm

You cannot get hookworm infection from hookworm eggs. They hatch in soil, releasing larvae (immature worms) that grow into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans.


Hookworm infection spreads primarily by walking barefoot on contaminated soil.


One kind of hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale, can also spread through eating the larvae.
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
People with only a few worms (light infections) usually have no symptoms. Heavy infections, (high number of worms), can cause a range of health problems, including 

Abdominal pain


Diarrhea


Blood and protein or nutrient loss


Rectal prolapse (When the rectum sags and comes out of the anus)


Slow physical and cognitive growth in infants and children. (Cognitive impairment is when a person has trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.)
Causes: N/A
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
To lower your risk of getting soil-transmitted helminth infections 

Wash your hands before handling food.


Wash, peel, and cook raw fruits and vegetables.


Avoid soil and drinking water contaminated with human feces.


Wear shoes when walking in soil that may be contaminated with human feces to prevent hookworm infection.
Medical care: Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for a soil-transmitted helminth infection under a microscope.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
Only prescription drugs can treat soil-transmitted helminth infections. The medications, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are known as anthelmintic medications. Treatment lasts between one and three days and is highly effective, regardless of the species of parasitic worm. See your healthcare provider if you think you have an infection caused by an STH parasite. 
Preventative Treatment
In certain tropical or subtropical countries or regions, some people are at higher risk for soil-transmitted helminth infections (hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm). These people often receive treatment without a prior stool exam. This is known as preventive treatment or "preventive chemotherapy". 
The high-risk groups identified by the World Health Organization are preschool and school-age children, women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and women who are breast feeding), and adults in occupations where there is a high risk of heavy infections. School-health programs often provide treatment to students. Health clinics treat pregnant women and younger children. 
Mass Drug Administration (MDA)
Treatment of soil-transmitted helminths and other "neglected tropical diseases" (NTDs) sometimes use mass drug administration (MDA). MDA treats multiple people, sometimes whole communities, or schools, at one time. The drugs used in MDA are safe and inexpensive or donated and offered to entire risk groups to prevent these diseases.

Risk: Risk factors
Anyone can get viral meningitis; however, the following factors can increase someone's risk.
Age
Children younger than 5 years old are at increased risk for viral meningitis.
Babies younger than 1 month old are most likely to have severe illness if they get viral meningitis.
Medical conditions
People with a weakened immune system are at increased risk for getting viral meningitis and having severe illness. Diseases, some medications (such as chemotherapy), and recent organ or bone marrow transplantations can weaken the immune system.

Close contacts aren't likely to develop meningitis‎
Close contacts of someone with viral meningitis can become infected with the virus that made that person sick. They aren't likely to develop meningitis though.
Prevention: Prevention
Limit virus exposure and spread
Many daily healthy habits can help prevent viral infections:

Wash your hands often, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet


Avoid close contact, such as touching and shaking hands, with people who are sick


Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces


Stay home when sick and keep sick children out of school

Overview: What it is
B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. 
People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days.
The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.
As the disease progresses, the virus spreads to and causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and spinal cord. Problems with breathing and death can occur one day to three weeks after symptoms appear. 
Keep Reading:
B Virus Symptoms and Complications
Causes: How it spreads
B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. You can get infected with B virus if you:

Overview: Overview
Babesiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Although there are many different species (types) of Babesia parasite found in animals, only a few infect people. The most common species to infect people in the United States is Babesia microti.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Many people with Babesiosis do not feel sick and have no symptoms. However, some people might get flu-like symptoms, such as:

Fever
Chills
Sweats
Headache
Body aches
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Fatigue

Since the parasites attack red blood cells, babesiosis can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Babesiosis can become a serious, even life-threatening illness for certain people, especially those who:

Do not have a spleen
Have a weak immune system for other reasons such as cancer, lymphoma, or HIV
Have serious health issues such as liver or kidney disease
Are older (> 50 years old)

Symptoms, if they appear, may start around a week after infection, but usually develop over a few weeks or months, or longer.
Causes: How it spreads
In the U.S. most Babesia infections are from blacklegged or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) bites. Ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Currently, most babesiosis cases occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest. 
Other less common ways of getting infected with Babesia include:

Getting a blood transfusion that has the parasite in it.
If a mother has babesiosis, she might pass it to her baby during pregnancy or when the baby is born.

Babesia parasites do not spread from person-to-person like the flu or the common cold.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
To reduce your risk of babesiosis, avoid outdoor areas infested with ticks. If you are in these areas, use tick repellents, wear socks, long-sleeved shirts, and pants, and check yourself and pets for ticks before going inside.
Keep Reading:
Preventing Babesiosis
Medical care: Diagnosis
A healthcare provider can diagnose babesiosis by examining a small sample of your blood under a microscope. This lab test can confirm the presence of the Babesia parasites in your red blood cells.
Another way your healthcare provider can diagnose babesiosis is by sending your blood samples to a special lab, such as the CDC or a health department, for testing.
Treatment: Treatment
If you have babesiosis, there is effective treatment. You usually do not need treatment if you have no symptoms or signs of babesiosis. Talk with your healthcare provider for more information.

Overview: What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition that happens when there is too much of certain bacteria in the vagina, causing an imbalance.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
How common is BV?
BV is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15-44.
Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV.
Causes: How it spreads
How does BV spread?
Researchers do not know the cause of BV. However, we do know the condition most often occurs in those who are sexually active. BV is a result of an imbalance of "good" and "harmful" bacteria in a vagina. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV.
We also do not know how sex causes BV. There also is no research to show that treating a sex partner affects whether someone gets BV. Having BV can increase your chances of getting other STDs.
Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. 
BV rarely affects those who have never had sex.
You cannot get BV from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
How can I avoid getting BV?
Healthcare providers and scientists do not completely understand how BV spreads or know how best to prevent it.
The following basic prevention steps may help lower your risk of getting BV:

Not having sex
Limiting your number of sex partners
Not douching
Using condoms the right way every time you have sex
Medical care: I’m pregnant. How does BV affect my baby?
Treating BV during pregnancy is very important. If you are pregnant and have BV, your baby is more likely to be born early (premature) or at a low birth weight. Low birth weight means having a baby that weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
How do I know if I have BV?
Many people with BV do not have symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may notice:

A thin white or gray vaginal discharge
Pain, itching, or burning in the vagina
A strong fish-like odor, especially after sex
Burning when peeing
Itching around the outside of the vagina

How will my healthcare provider know if I have BV?
A healthcare provider will examine your vagina for signs of discharge. They also can test a sample of vaginal fluid to determine if BV is present.
Is there a cure for BV?
A healthcare provider can treat BV with antibiotics. If you have symptoms, you should be checked and treated by a healthcare provider. It is important to take all the medicine your provider prescribes, even if your symptoms go away. Treatment also may reduce the risk for getting other STDs. BV can return even after treatment.
Male sex partners of women with BV do not need treatment. However, BV can spread between female sex partners.
What happens if I don't receive treatment?
At times, BV will go away without treatment. However, treatment can help avoid the increased chance of some serious health risks associated with BV, including:

Getting or transmitting HIV
Delivering your baby too early if you have BV while pregnant and
Getting other STDs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. These bacteria can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can make it difficult for you to have children

Overview: Overview
Balantidium coli is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes the infection called balantidiasis. While this type of infection is uncommon in the United States, humans and other mammals can become infected with Balantidium coli by ingesting infective cysts from food and water that is contaminated by feces. Mostly asymptomatic, Balantidium infection can cause such symptoms as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Balantidium coli infection in humans is rare in the United States. Balantidium coli is found throughout the world, but it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and developing countries. Because pigs are an animal reservoir, human infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised, especially if good hygiene is not practiced.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Most people infected with Balantidium coli experience no symptoms. Balantidium coli infects the large intestine in humans and produces infective microscopic cysts that are passed in the feces, potentially leading to re-infection or infection of others. People compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience more severe signs and symptoms. These include persistent diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, perforation of the colon can occur.
Causes: How it spreads
Balantidium coli is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans can become infected by eating and drinking contaminated food and water that has come into contact with infective animal or human fecal matter. Infection can occur in several ways, including the following examples:

Eating meat, fruits, and vegetables that have been contaminated by an infected person or contaminated by fecal matter from an infected animal,


Drinking and washing food with contaminated water, or


Having poor hygiene habits.

DPDx - Balantidium coli life cycle
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Balantidium coli infection can be prevented when traveling by following good hygiene practices. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Wash all fruits and vegetables with clean water when preparing or eating them, even if they have a removable skin.
Medical care: Testing
Stool samples can be examined by a laboratory. Microscopic examination can detect Balantidium coli in the stool.
Treatment: Treatment
The three medications often used to treat Balantidium coli are tetracycline, metronidazole, and iodoquinol. See your healthcare provider for treatment.

Overview: Overview
Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease).
For more information:

Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease)


Bartonella quintana infection


Bartonella bacilliformis infection 




B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria.

B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse.

B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies.
There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Overview: Overview
Baylisascaris infection is caused by a roundworm found in raccoons. This roundworm can infect people as well as a variety of other animals, including dogs. Human infections are rare but can be severe if the parasites invade the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans) or the brain (neural larva migrans).
Types: Species
Different species of Baylisascaris are associated with different animal hosts. For example, Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoons, and Baylisascaris columnaris is found in skunks. Cases of Baylisascaris infection in people are not frequently reported but can be severe. Baylisascaris procyonis is thought to pose the greatest risk to people because of the often-close association of raccoons to human dwellings.
Symptoms: Symptoms
The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is usually 1 – 4 weeks. If present, signs and symptoms can include

Nausea


Tiredness


Liver enlargement


Loss of coordination


Lack of attention to people and surroundings


Loss of muscle control


Blindness


Coma
Causes: Causes and spread
People become infected by consuming infectious eggs. Most infections are in children and others who are more likely to put dirt or animal waste in their mouth by mistake.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Eggs passed in raccoon feces are not immediately infectious. In the environment, eggs take 2 – 4 weeks to become infectious. If raccoons have set up a den or a latrine (places where raccoons defecate) in your yard, raccoon feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed carefully and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill. Care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. Treat decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane flame-gun (exercise proper precautions). Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces before the eggs become infectious will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.
Do not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets.
Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.
Medical care: Diagnosis
You should discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider, who will examine you and ask you questions (for example, about your interactions with raccoons or other wild animals). Baylisascaris infection is difficult to diagnosis in humans. There are no widely available tests, so the diagnosis is often made by ruling out other diseases.
Treatment: Treatment
A healthcare provider can discuss treatment options with you. No drug has been found to be completely effective against racoon roundworm in people. Albendazole, a broad spectrum anthelmintic, has been recommended for specific cases.
Early treatment might reduce serious damage caused by the infection. If you suspect you may have ingested raccoon feces, seek immediate medical attention.

Overview: Overview
Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite found throughout the world. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. A full understanding of Blastocystis and whether it causes disease in humans is unclear. There are prescription drugs available to treat blastocystosis in people with symptoms.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Many people with blastocystosis have no symptoms. However, some people who have Blastocystis in their stool (poop) have some of the following symptoms: 

Watery or loose stools
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Anal itching
Weight loss
Constipation
Excess gas

In some studies, blastocystosis has also been associated with various skin rashes and hives.
Causes: How it spreads
It is unclear how Blastocystis spreads. However, the number of people infected appears to increase in areas that use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). Studies have suggested that risk of infection may increase through:

Consuming contaminated food or water.
Working at or attending a daycare or childcare facility.
Close contact with a wide range of animals.

There is little risk of spreading the infection if you practice good personal hygiene, as outlined in the prevention steps.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
You can take steps to prevent blastocystosis.
Sanitation and hygiene precautions

Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies.


Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil or animals and before handling food.


Teach children the importance of handwashing.

Food precautions

Wash and peel fruits and vegetables before eating them.
Avoid water or food that may be contaminated.
When traveling in countries where the water supply may be unsafe,
Avoid drinking unboiled tap water.
Avoid uncooked foods washed with unboiled tap water.



Bottled or canned carbonated beverages, seltzers, pasteurized fruit drinks, and steaming hot coffee and tea are safe to drink.
Medical care: Diagnosis
If you think you have blastocystosis, speak with your healthcare provider. They may ask you to provide stool samples for testing. Diagnosis may be difficult, so your provider may ask you to submit several stool samples.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
Prescription drugs are available to treat blastocystosis. If you received a diagnosis of blastocystosis, speak with your healthcare provider about treatment options.

Overview: Overview
Botulism ("BOT-choo-liz-um") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death.
The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants.
The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.
The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known. 
The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are:

Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment


Low acid


Low sugar


Low salt


A certain temperature range


A certain amount of water



For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly.
Types: Most common types
There are 5 main kinds of botulism.
Foodborne botulism
Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin. Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin.
Wound botulism
Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism.
Infant botulism
For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin.
Iatrogenic botulism
Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.
Adult intestinal toxemia
Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill.

All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies.‎
If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism, immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

Overview: Overview
Bourbon virus is believed to be spread through the bite of an infected tick. The virus was discovered in 2014 and named for Bourbon County, Kansas where it was first identified. 
A limited number of Bourbon cases have been reported in the Midwest and southern United States. At this time, CDC does not know if the virus might be found in other areas of the United States.
People diagnosed with Bourbon have reported symptoms including fever, fatigue, rash, headache, other body aches, nausea, and vomiting. 
There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Bourbon. Reduce your risk of infection from Bourbon virus by preventing tick bites.


Overview: Overview
Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world.
In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water.
If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it.

Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms
Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. 
As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. 
Keep Reading:
Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection
Causes: N/A
Risk: Exposure risks
Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months. Infections often happen when it's been hot for long periods, resulting in higher water temperatures and lower water levels. 
A few infections have occurred when people used tap water that contained Naegleria fowleri  to rinse their sinuses or cleanse their nasal passages. 
In very rare instances, people have become infected from recreational water like splash pads and a surf park that did not have enough chlorine.
You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing water containing the ameba. You also can't get an infection from someone else or pass it on to others.  
Keep Reading:
What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection
Prevention: Reducing risk
To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection:

Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water.


Always keep your head above water in hot springs.


Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there.


Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages.



Keep Reading:
How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages
Medical care: Diagnosis
A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC. 
Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died.
Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM.
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
Naegleria fowleri can destroy brain tissue and cause the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection. 
PAM progresses very quickly. This has made treatments for the disease difficult to identify. There is some evidence that certain drugs may be effective.

Overview: What is RSV?
Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, RSV can cause serious illness in infants, some young children, and older adults. 
RSV spreads through coughing, sneezing, contact (like kissing the face of a child who has RSV), and contaminated surfaces. Transmission occurs most often during RSV season, which generally starts in the fall and peaks in the winter in most of the United States.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: N/A

Medical care: N/A
Treatment: RSV can be dangerous for infants and older adults
RSV can also cause more severe infections such as bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small airways in the lungs) and pneumonia (an infection of the lungs). It is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age.
Healthy adults and infants infected with RSV do not usually need to be hospitalized. But some people with RSV infection, especially older adults and infants younger than 6 months of age, may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated. 
In the most severe cases, a person may require additional oxygen, IV fluids if they can't eat or drink enough, or intubation (have a breathing tube inserted through the mouth and down to the airway) with mechanical ventilation (a machine to help a person breathe). In most of these cases, hospitalization only lasts a few days.

Overview: Overview
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a family of bacteria called Brucella.
You can get the disease when you come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that most commonly get brucellosis include cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hogs, among others. People can get brucellosis by:

Eating undercooked meat such as sheep, cow, goat, or camel.


Eating undercooked game meat such as bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hog.


Consuming unpasteurized (raw) milk or other dairy products made from contaminated milk.


Breathing in the bacteria that cause brucellosis.


Getting body fluids from infected animals in the eyes, nose, or mouth.


Preparing meat or hides after hunting.


Getting certain animal vaccines in the eyes, nose or mouth or accidentally injecting yourself when vaccinating animals


Working in a lab with brucellosis samples.



People with certain jobs or hobbies may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis, including:

Slaughterhouse workers


Hunters


Veterinarians and veterinary staff


Animal breeders or animal shelter staff


Laboratory workers



It is extremely rare for brucellosis to spread between people.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Signs and symptoms

Doctors examining a patient
If you think you've been exposed to brucellosis, contact your health care provider. 
Brucellosis can cause a range of signs and symptoms in people, and some can occur for a long time before it's diagnosed. The first symptoms can include:

Fever


Sweating


Generally feeling badly (malaise)


Not wanting to eat (anorexia)


Headache


Pain in muscles, joint, and/or back


Feeling more tired than usual (fatigue)



Other symptoms may continue or may come and go until you've had treatment, including:

Fevers that keep coming back


Arthritis


Swelling of the testicles and scrotum area


Infection of the heart (endocarditis)


Memory loss, confusion, and irritability


Depression


Swelling of the liver and/or spleen
Causes: N/A
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Eating or drinking infected animal products
The best way to prevent brucellosis infection is to be sure you don't eat or drink:

Undercooked meat


Unpasteurized (raw) dairy products, including milk, cheese, and ice cream



 Pasteurization is the heating process used to destroy harmful bacteria that may make milk and milk products unsafe to eat or drink.
If you are not sure whether a dairy product is pasteurized, don't eat or drink it.
Hunters and those who work with animals
People who work with animal tissues and body fluids, including animal caretakers (veterinarians, vet techs, shelter staff, etc.), hunters, butchers, and animal herdsman, are at higher risk of brucellosis infection. If you work with animal tissues, protect yourself by wearing:

Rubber gloves


Goggles


Gowns or aprons


Masks or respirators



View Larger
Protect yourself while working with animal tissues
If the animal is infected, this protective clothing will help keep the bacteria that causes brucellosis from getting into your eyes or inside a cut or wound on your skin.
Laboratory personnel
Brucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-associated bacterial infection. If you work in a lab, take precautions when handling samples to prevent infection. If you are exposed, determine your risk and follow recommendations for symptom monitoring and possible post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment.
Medical care: N/A
Treatment: Treatment and recovery
 Once your healthcare provider has confirmed that you have brucellosis from test results, you can begin treatment with antibiotics.
Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are:

Pregnant


Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin


Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines




Brucella RB51 treatment‎
If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection.

It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen.
Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

Overview:VHFs
Types: Types
Most VHFs fall into one of four families of virus:
Arenaviruses
Each arenavirus has one or a few closely related rodents that carry the virus without getting sick themselves. This is known as the reservoir, or source of the virus in nature. The reservoir can spread the virus to people through infected urine, saliva, or droppings, and can cause severe disease in people. 
People are infected with arenaviruses by:

Touching with rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials from an infected rodent


Breathing in air contaminated by rodent urine, droppings or nesting materials.


Being bitten or scratched by an infected rodent.


Eating food contaminated by urine, droppings, or saliva from an infected rodent.


Contact with another person who has certain arenaviruses, such as Chapare, Lassa, Machupo, and Lujo viruses.



Bunyavirales order
Viruses in the Bunyavirales order are spread by rodents or insects, such as mosquitos, ticks, or sand flies. They can produce mild to severe disease in animals and people. Many of these viruses cannot spread between people. However, person-to-person spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has occurred in healthcare settings where infection control was limited.
Filoviruses
Filoviruses can cause severe illness in people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and gorillas). The Egyptian rousette bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a cave-dwelling bat, and the reservoir for Marburg virus. Bats infected with orthomarburgviruses do not show obvious signs of illness. It's not known what animal carries ebolaviruses in nature but scientists suspect that bats are likely involved. Once filoviruses are introduced into the human population, they can spread between people through contact with an infected person's body fluids. Caretakers and healthcare providers who do not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are at higher risk of infection.
Flaviviruses
Flaviviruses, are found throughout the world. These viruses, which are primarily spread by mosquitoes and ticks, can cause mild to severe disease or even death. They can also cause disease in animals, creating a large economic and social impact on people living in affected areas.
Paramyxoviruses
Paramyxoviruses can cause sudden onset of respiratory disease. While there are many viruses included within the Paramyxoviridae family, Hendra and Nipah viruses are considered more serious because they require a specialized lab (biosafety level 4 lab) and can cause serious disease, spread between animals and people , and have no vaccine or treatment currently available.

Symptoms: N/A
Causes: N/A
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Prevention
Prevention of VHFs and other HCIDs depends on the host reservoir and how the virus spreads. Prevention measures can target reservoir exclusion activities (for example, use of insect repellents, bed nets, and protective clothing and disinfection procedures while caring for a sick person) or by sealing up and setting traps in homes and other buildings when a rodent infestation is discovered.

Overview: What it is
Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria commonly found in soil and water.
Types: N/A
Symptoms: Symptoms
Symptoms vary, ranging from no symptoms to serious respiratory infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease. Other symptoms may include: 

Fever


Fatigue
Causes: How it spreads

Exposure from water, soil or aqueous (watery) environments.


Contact with contaminated surfaces.


Contact with contaminated equipment.


Person-to-person transmission, more commonly in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Risk: N/A
Prevention: Reducing risk
Patients and caregivers should:

Keep their hands clean, particularly before and after caring for wounds or touching a medical device.


Ask others to clean their hands before touching the patient or handling medical devices.


Avoid exposing wounds and indwelling medical devices (devices put in or connected to the patient's body) to nonsterile water.


Allow healthcare staff to clean their room daily when in a healthcare setting.



Healthcare providers should always follow recommended infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.
Medical care: N/A
Treatment: Treatment
Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis but generally include antibiotics. Unfortunately, many B. cepacia complex germs are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.
